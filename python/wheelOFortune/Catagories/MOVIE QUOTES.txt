AFTER ALL TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
BYE FELICIA!
FRANKLY MY DEAR I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
GO AHEAD MAKE MY DAY
HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU KID
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES?
I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE
I'LL BE BACK
I'LL GET YOU MY PRETTY AND YOUR LITTLE DOG TOO!
IF YOU BUILD IT HE WILL COME
IT'S SHOWTIME!
LION AND TIGERS AND BEARS OH MY!
